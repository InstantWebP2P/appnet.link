### Usage/API:

    1. create AppNet client

    var APPNET = require('appnet.link');
    var nmcln = new APPNET({
      usrinfo: {domain: '51dese.com', usrkey: 'dese'}, // fill usrkey. And, 51dese.com is only useful domain by now
    });
    nmcln.on('ready', function(){
      console.log('appnet.link ready with vURL:'+nmcln.vurl);
      // ...
    });

    2. hook node.js web server in peer. Websocket server is supported with wspp module as well. This is an express App example. file peerweb.js.

    var express = require('express');
    var WebSocket = require('wspp').wspp;
    var WebSocketServer = WebSocket.Server;
    var APPNET = require('appnet.link');
    var nmcln = new APPNET({
      usrinfo: {domain: '51dese.com', usrkey: 'dese'}, // fill your usrkey. And, 51dese.com is only useful domain by now
    });
    nmcln.on('ready', function(){
      // 2.1
      // create your express App
      var app = express();
      app.use(express.directory(__dirname + '/public'));
      app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
      app.use(function(req, res){
          res.end('invalid path');
      });
      // hook app on business server
      nmcln.bsrv.srv.on('request', app);
      console.log('Now access your web server via URL:'+nmcln.vurl);
      // 2.2
      // create your websocket server
      var wss = new WebSocketServer({httpp: true, server: nmcln.bsrv.srv});
      wss.on('connection', function(client){
        console.log('new ws connection');
      });
      console.log('Now connect to your websocket server via URL:'+nmcln.vurl);
    });
